. Our best-
performing Random Forest model achieved 96.14% accuracy
and an F1-score of 0.9516, demonstrating the effectiveness of
text-based classification approaches for phishing detection. The
modelâ€™s high recall rate (96.59%) for phishing emails is particu-
larly valuable for security applications where missing malicious
content poses significant risks.
